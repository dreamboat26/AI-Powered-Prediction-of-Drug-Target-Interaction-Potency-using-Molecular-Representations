# üß† AI-Powered Prediction of Drug-Target Interaction Potency Using Molecular Representations

This repository contains code, datasets, and models for predicting **Drug-Target Interaction (DTI) potency** using both traditional machine learning methods and **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)**. The primary goal is to predict **pIC50** values from molecular structure data using representations derived from SMILES strings and molecular graphs.

---

## üìò Abstract

Drug discovery relies heavily on accurately predicting the strength of interactions between small molecules and their biological targets. This project explores:

- A **baseline Random Forest model** trained on traditional molecular descriptors
- Advanced **Graph Neural Network models** (GCN, GIN) trained on molecular graphs

The results demonstrate that GNN-based models significantly outperform traditional methods in predicting bioactivity (pIC50).
